# Mines Market Calendar

This is the server repository for grabbing JSON files from our school's lunch menu, Mines Market. We're given it in a variable on the website passed through as raw elements.
The backend of this will work to make the frontend of our program - something that allows any student to rate meal stations at our school. We made this because our lunch menu shifts
from bad to good to bad again all the time, and we'd like to know when things like ice cream or the drinks are empty/not working.



"It's better to think the food will be bad and be pleasantly surprised than to naively always think it'll be good." 

-Sun Tzu (he didn't actually say this but it'd be cool if he did)
